# BRIX - Open Source Script
BRIX is a Open Source script for the old Mafia 2 Multiplayer and the new Mafia 2 Online mods. By default, BRIX is freeroam sandbox game mode. Players are able to do various cool things without any special permissions. For example, each player is able to spawn a vehicle, and customize it anyhow they want. Also, they can teleport to another player, to pre-defined location and they even can actually warp anywhere they want - inside mountains, over the sky or just 30 feet at the time - everywhere. Original BRIX doesn't use accounts, so no registration needed at all.

### Note
> I would like to thank each participated member very, very humbly for using the BRIX script. Sadly, the time has come for me to admit that the project will no longer be continued or supported by me, at least not until the development of the M2MP has been renewed again. **Despite this, the project is still available for everyone who is interested of using, improving and supporting it!**

BRIX is great in many ways. If you are new to scripting, or just new to scripting M2MP, it's better than great. The script is clear and has various functions that you can learn from. All important things in the script are commented, so you know what's going on in them and you'll be notified not to do something if it's not recommended.

As opposition, if you are well experienced scripter, this is a great basis script for your new project. No need to write down everything from a scratch yourself - there are some cool stuff in this, and it's all there waiting for you to take it.

The best part in all this is that BRIX was made to be shared. You can get your copy for free and you can do whatever you want with it. You can remove, modify and add stuff in it. Neat, huh? If you say "Thank You", that's everything I want.
