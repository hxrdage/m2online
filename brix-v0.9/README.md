# BRIX-v0.9
A game mode script for Mafia 2 Online.

Script made by Bularthip. Special thanks to Rolandd and Mafia 2 Online/Multiplayer community.

In order to use this game mode you need Mafia 2 Online server files. Simply download these files into \resources\gamemode directory and use config.xml to load these files. Make sure you load .nut files under \client and \server with meta.xml.

Example:

-server\config.xml

--server\resources\brix

---server\resources\brix\client

---server\resources\brix\server

---server\resources\brix\meta.xml


Simply edit the settings on top of brix.nut as you like. If you know what you're doing you can edit the functions as much as you want.
